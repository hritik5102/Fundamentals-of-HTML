<!-- 1️⃣ What is DOCTYPE ? 
    Doctype: A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. 

    The **Doctype** is not an element or tag, it lets the browser know about the version of or standard of HTML or any other markup language that is being used in the document.

    <!-- 3️⃣ What is HTML ? 

      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. 
      
      It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. 
      
      It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. 
      
      HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

    <!-- 4️⃣ The <h1> element appears on the page when loaded in the browser — generally this should be used once per page, to mark up the title of your page content (the story title, or news headline, or whatever is appropriate to your usage.)
     -->
    <h1>My Website</h1>

    <!--  paragraph tag -->
    <p>This is my very first website</p>

    <!-- 6️⃣ HTML Comments 
      Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#html_comments

      HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates
