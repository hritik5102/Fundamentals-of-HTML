    <h1>Emphasis and importance tags</h1>
    <hr />

    <!-- 1️⃣ Italic 
    
      🔗 Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#emphasis

      The first sentence sounds genuinely relieved that the person wasn't late. In contrast, the second one sounds sarcastic or passive-aggressive, expressing annoyance that the person arrived a bit late.

      In HTML we use the <em> (emphasis) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more interesting to read, these are recognized by screen readers and spoken out in a different tone of voice. 
        
      Browsers style this as italic by default, but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get italic styling. To do that, you'd use a <span> element and some CSS, or perhaps an <i> element.
    -->
    <p>I am glad you weren't late.</p>
    <p>I am <em>glad</em> you weren't <em>late</em>.</p>

    <!-- 2️⃣ Bold 

      🔗 Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#strong_importance
    
    To emphasize important words, we tend to stress them in spoken language and bold them in written language. For example:
    -->

    <p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</p>

    <p>I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</p>

    <!-- 
      In HTML we use the <strong> (strong importance) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more useful, again these are recognized by screen readers and spoken in a different tone of voice. 
        
      Browsers style this as bold text by default, but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get bold styling. To do that, you'd use a <span> element and some CSS, or perhaps a <b> element 

      You can nest strong and emphasis inside one another if desired
     -->
    <p>
      This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong> — if you drink it,
      <strong>you may <em>die</em></strong
      >.
    </p>

    <!-- 3️⃣ Italic, bold, underline...(presentational element, not semantic element)

      Reference : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#italic_bold_underline...
      
      - The elements we've discussed so far (em and strong) have clearcut associated semantics. 
      
      - The situation with <b>, <i>, and <u> is somewhat more complicated. They came about so people could write bold, italics, or underlined text in an era when CSS was still supported poorly or not at all. Elements like this, which only affect presentation and not semantics, are known as presentational elements and should no longer be used because, as we've seen before, semantics is so important to accessibility, SEO, etc.

      -  The concept of italics, bold, underline isn't very helpful to people using screen readers.
