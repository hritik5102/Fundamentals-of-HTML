    <!-- 1️⃣ Description list 
      
      🔗 Reference : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting#description_lists
      
      - The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers.

      - Description lists use a different wrapper than the other list types (ul and ol) — <dl>.
      - In addition each term is wrapped in a <dt> (description term) element, and each description is wrapped in a <dd> (description definition) element.

    <hr />

    <dl>
      <dt>soliloquy</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their
        inner thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the
        audience (but not to other characters.)
      </dd>
      <dt>monologue</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them
        with the audience and any other characters present.
      </dd>
      <dt>aside</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
        humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or
        piece of additional background information.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <!-- 📌 Note that it is permitted to have a single term with multiple descriptions, for example: -->
    <dl>
      <dt>aside</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
        humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or
        piece of additional background information.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        In writing, a section of content that is related to the current topic,
        but doesn't fit directly into the main flow of content so is presented
        nearby (often in a box off to the side.)
      </dd>
    </dl>
