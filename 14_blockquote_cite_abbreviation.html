    <h1>Block and Inline quotations</h1>
    <hr />

    <!-- 1️⃣ Blockquotes 

      🔗 Reference : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting#blockquotes

      If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) 
      is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a <blockquote> element to signify this, 
      and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute. For example, the 
      following markup is taken from the MDN <blockquote> element page:
     -->
    <p>
      The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
      <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is
      an extended quotation.
    </p>

    <!-- To turn this into a block quote, we would just do this: -->

    <p>Here below is a blockquote...</p>
    <blockquote
      cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote"
    >
      <p>
        The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
        <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text
        is an extended quotation.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <!-- 2️⃣ Inline quotations 
      
      🔗 Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting#inline_quotations

      Inline quotations work in exactly the same way, except that they use the <q> element. 
      For example, the below bit of markup contains a quotation from the MDN <q> page:

      The quote element — <q> — is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.

      Browser default styling will render this as normal text put in quotes to indicate a quotation
    -->
    <p>
      The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is
      <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q"
        >intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q
      >
    </p>

    <!-- 3️⃣ Cite tag 

       Referencce : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting#citations

      There is a <cite> element, but this is meant to contain the title of the resource being quoted, 
      e.g. the name of the book. There is no reason, however, why you couldn't link the text inside 
      <cite> to the quote source in some way:

      Citations are styled in italic font by default.
    -->
    <p>
      According to the
      <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
        <cite>MDN blockquote page</cite></a
      >:
    </p>

    <blockquote
      cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote"
    >
      <p>
        The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
        <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text
        is an extended quotation.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is
      <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q"
        >intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q
      >
      -- <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q"> <cite>MDN q page</cite></a
      >.
    </p>

    <!-- 4️⃣ Abbreviations 

      🔗 Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting#abbreviations
    
     <abbr> — this is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym, and provide a full expansion of the term. 
    -->
    <p>
      We use
      <a href="#" title="ABCD">
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
      </a>
      to structure our web documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Green did it in the kitchen
      with the chainsaw.
